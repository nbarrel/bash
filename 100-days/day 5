# more regex
#looking for emails  not a problem 

#!/bin/bash

file_path="/emails.txt"
#lets recap the regex \b are our boundaries; A-Za-z0-9_%+- are all valid characters that an email can have; {2,} means that the top level domain has to be 2 characters long
# if you change {2,} to {2,4} means anything 2-4 characters long
cat "$file_path" | grep -oP "\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b"
# you can add a >>  output.txt to append to a document the output
